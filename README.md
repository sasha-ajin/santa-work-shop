# Santa Work Shop

As time went on, **Santa** became more and more tired and one day he decided to optimize the work in his workshop.

He gathered his three most trusted **gnomes** and introduced them to the new process of work. \
The process and way of working that Santa Claus described was as follows:

The workshop would now produce only two types of Toys: A **"Doll**" and a **"Bicycle"**. \
In order not to go to The Gnomes every day, Santa Claus bought a **magic board**,where he would write which of the two toys he need for, and the gnomes would watch it, and when they saw the written toy, each gnome would take the toy from the workshop. \
To rule the magic board, Santa Claus had to say the magic words "I need dolls" and "I need bicycle", and immediately the board would be inscribed "doll" or "bicycle".

You should use **design patterns** : Singleton, Command, Observer, Abstract factory or Factory method.

**Objects**: Santa, Magic Board, Gnomes, Bicycle, Doll, Factory, "I need for Bicycle", "I need for Doll".
